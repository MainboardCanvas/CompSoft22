Lecture Contents
================

In Lecture 11 we want to cover dynamical problems of quantum mechanics. We did solve stationary problems in Lecture 10, but now we want to make things move. We will therefore consider wavepackets and their dynamics and see how to deal with them.

1. Quantum dynamics primer
2. Particle in a box
3. Tunneling

I hope you stay motivated! Stay safe!
